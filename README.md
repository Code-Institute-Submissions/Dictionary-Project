# MILESTONE PROJECT 3: [ABC DICTIONARY](https://dictionary-project.herokuapp.com/)

## SOURCE: [Project Repository](https://github.com/stanciudorin/Dictionary-Project)

## ABOUT THE PROJECT
<p>ABC Dictionary is a platform for parents whose children are at the words-learning stage. My aim with this project was to help children learn their first words quicker as, the project in its core base, it has got the most common words that a child should learn first.

The idea for this project came to me as I am a parent myself as well and we are at the point where our little one is learning his first words. I have also tried to help other parents like myself to let them know what words we are staring learning first and also to give them the opportunity of inputting their knowledge into the ABC Dictionary and grow the words database so that children can learn new words every day.

As I had just completed the Data Centric Development Module, learning about Python and the well-known Flask framework, I decided to implement this framework as well as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Mongo DB and Heroku and create a web app that has the full CRUD functionality, for anyone interested to use the website.
